#Tuen

*Tsuen (å…¨)* means whole in Chinese. It serves as a holistic view of an individual. Something like an visualization of data connected to a person. 

##Why?

Currently most of a person's data are siloed in different vendors' own cloud. This project goal's is to consolidate them into the own silo of a person to do meaningful analytics. Some may argue this of [Credit Seasame of Chinese government](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34592186), this is a offline version for individuals only. The nature of open source and self-deployment is essential to keep this personal and personal only.

##Current

The project has just been kick off. So it is always subjected to changes(exciting no?) 

##Deployment

##Development
